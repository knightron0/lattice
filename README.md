# lattice

some kind of an ml library in cuda

rough timeline: 
- [ ] feedforward neural network 
- [ ] manual gradient calculation for backward pass
- [ ] automatic gradient calculation
- [ ] add convolution expression
- [ ] convolutional neural network

...some intermediate steps, then eventually:
- [ ] transformer


task for initial steps: [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer)
